Friends, start here!

1st: Snowkid's commentary and introduction:

This Orginazation is dedicated to WHACKD token, an idea that is based on bringing awareness to corruption and trust issues with the government. Aside from political issues, the idea of a meme token to reflect on this shows how trivial it seems to be, to the dismay of many. 

I didn't make WHACKD, but I am sure whoever did believes this. One person cannot make a movement. They must be created by the boots of many. Let's get off our asses and do something instead of watching from the sidelines on crypto twitter. Join the orginization, write an issue, make a pull request, fix a bug, make a project, take an action, but dont just fuck off on your couch watching football. 

Things are needed. I could do them all but that wouldn't bring anything more to the table than I already have. I DARE YOU (greta: How dare you?) to start to contribute here. Build your own project and add it here! 

The goal here is to build a community and the way to do this is via 100% transparecy therefore open source is the way to go. If you don't understand git/vcs/github, you get accredited automatically by your actions here. 

Documents need to be written and edited - I made an empty project called whitepaper, you know what to do.

If you dont understand github, google it. Foundations of git are great to have, I recommend: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2

Cheers Bruh's - I'll continue helping out but I won't (and cannot) do it alone.
