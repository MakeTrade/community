# Here's a list of things that would be beneficial to the project:

* Needs a long term solution for VPS hosting. This will ultimately "serve" as host for various whackd things e.g. WhackdBot and Various games. This could be hardware at someone's house or a VPS provider, prefer 100% uptime. Shell access required. There are some available solutions for roughly $10 a month, sop this might also be a good donor/bounty solution.
